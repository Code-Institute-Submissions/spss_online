In particular, attacking an old problem with advanced predictive analytics is going to spur an array of changes to business processes and with this, a necessary change of perspective. Staff will now be tasked with using the results of models to prioritise who they target with marketing materials, who they call and which products they promote to them. In times of transition, staff can feel overwhelmed, confused and frustrated if communication is poor. In fact lack of staff buy-in is one of the top reasons for the failure of newly adopted predictive analytics solutions.\r\n\r\n1. Start small, talk business\r\n2. Include the business from the beginning\r\n3. Identify obstacles\r\n4. Make a clear deployment plan\r\n5. Keep the analysts involved\r\n6. Prioritise good communication\r\n7. Know when to stop",
